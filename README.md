# Rust Games

Small gamedev projects written in the Rust Programming Language.

They are written using [macroquad](https://crates.io/crates/macroquad), a really clean and straightforward gamedev library.

These are small projects I wrote to learn the Rust language, so there might be mistakes, things that could be done better, or over-engeneered stuff (as I tried to learn and code as many features as possible).

**Contributions are welcome!**

## Notes

### Game of Life

-   Check the `src/consts.rs` file. It contains a set of constants that will let you customize the game parameters.

### Pong

-   If your press F1, the debug mode will toggle. It shows both the FPS counter and a debug print of the game current state.
