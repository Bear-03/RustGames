# Rust Games

Small gamedev projects written in the Rust Programming Language.

They are written using [macroquad](https://crates.io/crates/macroquad), a really
clean and straightforward gamedev library.

These are small projects I wrote to learn the Rust language, so there might be
mistakes, things that could be done better, or over-engeineered stuff (as I tried
to learn and code as many features as possible).

**Contributions are welcome!**

## Notes

Both games toggle an FPS counter when the F1 key is pressed.

### Game of Life

-   Check the `src/consts.rs` file. It contains a set of constants that will let you
    customize the game parameters.

### Pong

-   If your press F1, the debug view will also print the current game state.
